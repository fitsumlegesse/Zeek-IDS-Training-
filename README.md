You can start learning about zeek IDS , our engine in NetworkFort
Not all the links are related your work
The project is about deploying a Zeek IDS and then pushing the logs in ELK Stack for visual viewing the security event.
## 2. Deploying Zeek and Integration with ELK Stack
You can start from here. You don’t need to understand everything today but hopefully you would be able to work on this in next 3 to 6 months.
